# Python-api-challenge
The challenge consists of two parts.
WeatherPy folder has two jupiter notebooks files VacationPy.ipynb and WeatherPy.ipynb files, api_keys.py files with api keyse for each part and output data folder contains visualisation and csv file.

Registration on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and [GeoApify](https://www.geoapify.com/) and API keys creation are required to perform the challenge.  

## Part 1: WeatherPy
A python script was created to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. The [citipy Python library](https://pypi.org/project/citipy/)  and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) were used. 
Plots were created to showcase the relationship between Weather Variables and Latitude.
Linear Regression was computed for Each Relationship.

## Part 2: VacationPy
A map, that displays a point for every city in the output file from Part 1, was created.
The [Geoapify API](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs) and the [Python library hvplots](https://pypi.org/project/hvplot/) were used to create map visualizations.
